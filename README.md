# Solar-Monitoring-System
In this project :
1) Website Code for displaying the collected data from sensors
2) Arduino code for sensors to perform extraction and sending it to the servers.

Introduction:
Hello Myself Pakshal Shah with my team-mate Kunal Jain have developed a project called Solar Monitoring System for our final year diploma .
This project is based on the theme of Internet of Things(IOT).

Purpose:
For a sustained Solar Panel generation in a household , a lacking need was monitoring and mainatainance of the system. For this problem statement we came up with the idea 
of solar monitoring system. This system is capable of creating an awareness to users that how much profit was generated from the solar panel and if there is a need of 
maitanance to it.

Requirements:
1)Arduino Uno
2)Sensors
3)Wires
4)Solar Panel
5)Battery
6)Appliances

Future Scope and advancement:
One can add a prediction feature of how much revenue will be generated in future according to the data collected by sensors.As increasing in the application of solar panels 
the monitoring systems will also be in a great demand.
